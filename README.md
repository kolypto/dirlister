dirlister
=========

Extremely sumple directory listing script.

The requirements were:

* FTP access to a public folder
* Ban the execution any scripts/binaries that might be uploaded to compromise the server
* Allow the user to specify comments to each file
* Display the files' list, protected by a password
* Simple but fancy design
